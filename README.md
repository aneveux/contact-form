PHP, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery Contact Form
=====================================
About
-----
I'm clearly not a web developer, but a few weeks ago, I had to develop some 
kind of contact form for a website, using classical technologies for basic websites 
such as PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In a first time, I had a look at existing resources on the internet, and I actually 
found quite a lot of really interesting things... But I never found a complete solution, 
which includes both a pretty contact form, some PHP source code to send the e-mail, and 
a few code in order to manage the security.

As I don't have a lot of experience in web development, I found various articles about 
different aspects of a contact from: its design, its organization, its security, etc. And 
I tried to put everything altogether. And as it took me a few time, I thought it could be 
interesting to share what I implemented.

I assume I'm not a web developer, so if you want to provide some enhancements to the 
source code I wrote, it'll be a pleasure for me to learn from your comments.

Thank you

 * Stephanie Walter, for her wonderful article which allows to develop easily a really 
 pretty contact form. [Check it out !](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/01/23/full-css3-html5-contact-form-with-no-images/).

I also found a lot of great advices everywhere on the internet, especially on 
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).
